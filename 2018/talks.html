            <br/>
	    <p class="bio">Ellen is the manager of the MATLAB I/O group at MathWorks.  She leads a group of software engineers developing core MATLAB features for importing and exporting data -- including big data --  for text, spreadsheet, audio, video, image, and scientific formats.  Ellen and her team are passionate about providing a wide range of I/O functionality -- from parsing simple text files, to reading/writing complex binary image and scientific data, to accessing big data in cloud computing frameworks for large-scale data analytics.  Prior to MathWorks, Ellen was a software engineer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, developing MATLAB and C/C++ software for image and signal processing applications.  Ellen holds a BS in Molecular Biology and an MS in Computer Information Systems, both from Florida Institute of Technology.

            <br/>
	    <p class="bio">Professor Michelle Borkin works on the development of novel visualization techniques and tools to enable new insights and discoveries in data. She works across disciplines to bring together computer scientists, doctors, and astronomers to collaborate on new analysis and visualization techniques, and cross-fertilize techniques across disciplines. Her research resulted in the development of novel computer assisted diagnostics in cardiology, scalable visualization solutions for large network data sets, and novel astrophysical visualization tools and discoveries. Her main research interests include information and scientific visualization, hierarchical and multidimensional data representations, network visualization, visualization cognition, user interface design, human computer interaction (HCI), and evaluation methodologies.

Prior to joining Northeastern, Professor Borkin was a postdoctoral research fellow in computer science at the University of British Columbia, as well as an associate in computer science at Harvard and research fellow at Brigham & Women’s Hospital. She received her PhD in Applied Physics at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) in 2014. She’s also earned an MS in Applied Physics and a BA in Astronomy and Astrophysics & Physics from Harvard University. She was previously a National Science Foundation (NSF) graduate research fellow, a National Defense Science and Engineering graduate (NDSEG) fellow, and a TED fellow.</p>
